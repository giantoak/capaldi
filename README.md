Capyldi is a Python-based time series expert system that can run both R and python methods. (Well, it *will* be.) At present, it is a module for bulk execution of time series algorithms on a variety of data. It currently incorporates:

* Markov-Modulated Poisson Point Processes ([MMPP](https://github.com/giantoak/mmppr))
* ARIMA
* E-Divisive With Medians ([Twitter's Breakout Detection](https://github.com/twitter/BreakoutDetection))
